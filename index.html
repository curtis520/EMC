		   <h1>relativity</h1>  
			   <p>The are about gravitation. He figured out that the space can be changed, when we put the things that it has any mass, it will be changed following the mass. </p>

        <h1> question </h1>
              <p>He used infinitesimal and matrix to be bastic, and calculating the formula for gravity.</p>
       <img src="2.gif"   alt="E=MC" height="300" width="750">
       <h1> reason</h1>
    <p>He used math to figure out that Newton is wrong, because Newton said that gravity will be same and the height and distance will be stable.</p>

          <h1>speical <br> relativity</h1>
          <p>They are about the time that they believe the time is made by lots of elements.</p>
       <img src="4.png"   alt="E=MC" height="800" width="800">
         <h1> question</h1>
         <p>However,we haven't got any true things to proof the things, as he only used math for figuring out the furmula.</p>
       <img src="5.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="300" width="800">
        <h1> reason</h1>
        <p>He concentrated at quantum mechanics and believe that there is a space for time cosisting</p>
       <img src="6.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="800" width="800">
        <h1> scientist</h1>
        <p>He is a genius on math, he could remeber all the numbershe looked before.  </p>
       <img src="7.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="500" width="800">
    <h1> master <br> peace</h1>
    <p>If the theory be proofed, and maybe we could invent time machine. To be specific, the time machine in Doreamon. </p>
       <img src="8.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="300" width="800">
        <h1> doing</h1>
        <p> We need to concentrate at the other line(space) that owned by time so that we could did something on that.</p>
        <img src="9.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="300" width="800"> 
       <h1> reason</h1>
        <img src="10.jpg"   alt="E=MC" height="300" width="800">
      <p>We can only use calculate the time, because the time has no mass that we couldn't notice it and also look at it.</p>
